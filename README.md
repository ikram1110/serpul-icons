# Serpul Icons Dataset

Icons dataset for PPOB Application

## Source

We didn't create this icon from scratch; instead, we used a design from Figma by [Jordan Hughes](https://www.figma.com/@designer), which was also available for free. The link is provided below.

What we did was select several icons that align with our company's business. We then converted these icons to SVG format and further transformed them into a font format using [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/).
